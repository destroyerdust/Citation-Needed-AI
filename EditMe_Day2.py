CS Games 2011
AI Competition

Chris Iverach-Brereton

This file contains the Player class & related namespace for day 1 of the competition

Competitors must NOT create any code that illegally edits the state of the game (e.g.
changing human/zombie hit points).  Doing so may result in disqualification

Competitors must edit this file to create their AI for the competition

The AI must analyze the state of the world and assign two actions to their Survivor.
Available actions are:
    survivor.move(int) -- walk to an adjacent square (movement is orthogonal only)
                          directions are: GameSquare.DIRECTION_UP, .DIRECTION_DOWN, .DIRECTION_LEFT, .DIRECTION_RIGHT
    _players[i].attack(GameSquare) -- attack a zombie in an adjacent square (may be adjacent diagonally)
    _players[i].shoot(GameSquare) -- fire at a zombie.  The square may be any distance away, but requires clear LOS.  Uses 1 ammunition
    _players[i].search() -- search the survivor's current square for supplies
    
Each game square may be searched exactly once.
Searching a GameSquare may result in:
    - extra HP
    - extra ammunition
    - better melee or ranged accuracy
Humans may perform the same action multiple times in a turn, but are limited to exactly 2 actions
total for any given turn

Anything written to STDERR will be printed out by the server for debugging purposes

        Competitors must edit this function.
        You control a group of humans.  Each human can take two actions on their turn:
        e.g. move, move
        e.g. move, shoot
        e.g. shoot, move
        e.g. shoot, shoot
        e.g. attack, shoot
        e.g. move, search
        etc...
        
        Move accepts a direction as the parameter: GameSquare.DIRECTION_UP/.DIRECTION_DOWN/.DIRECTION_LEFT/.DIRECTION_RIGHT
        
        Shoot requires a target square and uses ammunition
        
        Attack requires a target square adjacent to the human (this square can be adjascent diagonally)
        Attack does not consume ammunition
        
        Search will search the current square for supplies.  Each square may only be searched once
        The human might find more ammunition, a bigger gun, first aid supplies
        
        For debugging anything you write to stderr will be printed by the server with a "[debug]" prefix
